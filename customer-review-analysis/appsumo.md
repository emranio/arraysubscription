## #1 Payment Gateway Integrations

Migration from WooCommerce Subscriptions to WPSubscription is a critical feature for existing store owners.

The migration should preserve Stripe payment profiles and maintain billing continuity. Currently handled on a case-by-case basis by the support team, but customers expect self-service documentation and automated import tools.

## #3 Backend Subscription Management (Admin)

Administrators need comprehensive backend capabilities to create, modify, and manage subscriptions directly from the WordPress/WooCommerce admin panel without requiring frontend customer actions. This includes creating manual subscriptions, modifying existing subscription quantities/prices, adding/removing products from active subscriptions, adjusting renewal dates, and applying discounts. The ability to start subscriptions from backend orders and manage subscription lifecycle events administratively is crucial for businesses handling B2B sales or custom arrangements.

### Customer Reviews/Questions

Customers want the flexibility to modify their active subscriptions by upgrading, downgrading, or switching between different subscription tiers/plans without creating entirely new subscriptions. This includes changing billing cycles, adjusting quantities, adding/removing products, and switching between variable product options. The system should handle prorated billing adjustments and maintain payment method continuity. Users also want the ability to pause, resume, or skip specific billing cycles. This is particularly important for businesses offering tiered membership models or flexible subscription boxes.

## #5 Installment Plans & Split Payments
### Feature Details
The ability to offer flexible payment options beyond traditional recurring subscriptions, including installment plans where customers pay a fixed number of payments (e.g., 3 monthly payments) that automatically end after completion. This differs from ongoing subscriptions as it's more suitable for one-time purchases split into multiple payments. The feature should support different payment structures like "$10 upfront, followed by $30 × 3 payments" or split a $179 purchase into "$90 × 2" payments. This is particularly valuable for digital products, courses, and higher-ticket items where customers prefer payment flexibility.

### Feature Details

## #6 Free Trials & Signup Fees
### Feature Details
Businesses need the ability to offer free trial periods before charging customers, allowing them to test products/services risk-free. This includes configurable trial lengths (e.g., 7-day, 14-day, 30-day trials) with automatic conversion to paid subscriptions. Signup fees allow charging a one-time upfront fee in addition to the recurring subscription cost, useful for onboarding, setup costs, or access fees. The system should clearly display trial periods and signup fees during checkout and handle the transition from trial to paid seamlessly.

### Customer Reviews/Questions
- "Free trial support - Does the LTD here on appsumo also offer Free trial support? I see on your site directly, all plans include Free trial support, however, it's not listed here on appsumo" - Free trial availability confirmation

## #9 Renewal Pricing & Different Renewal Rates
### Feature Details
The ability to charge different prices for the initial subscription period versus renewal periods. For example, offering an introductory rate of $19 for the first month, then $39 for subsequent months. This is distinct from signup fees as it's built into the product pricing itself. Common use case for software licenses where first-year pricing differs from renewal pricing. Currently limited to signup fee implementation, but customers want native support for different renewal pricing directly on the product level.

### Customer Reviews/Questions
- "Please point me to the 'different renewal pricing' feature (not signup fee) - The missing feature is to charge different prices for renewals. As of now you are only able to charge a signup fee, but that shows up at the subtotals and not directly at the product. I would like to just say pay X for the first period, then pay Y. Typical software license renewal use case" - Feature request for different renewal pricing
- "You can currently achieve this only using signup fees. I understand what you're looking for, and we've already added this feature request to our priority list for future updates" - Current workaround and roadmap addition

The plugin must use standard WooCommerce hooks so legal compliance plugins can inject required information.

## #16 Automatic vs Manual Payment Methods
### Feature Details
Clear distinction between automatic recurring payments (credit card, PayPal automatic, Stripe) and manual payment methods (bank transfer, check, invoice). For subscription products, businesses may want to offer only automatic payment methods to ensure reliable recurring billing. The system should allow admins to restrict payment method options specifically for subscription products while keeping other payment methods available for one-time purchases. This prevents customers from selecting "Pay by Invoice" for subscriptions which can't be automatically renewed.

### Customer Reviews/Questions

---

Integration with license manager plugins to generate activation codes, manage license activations across multiple sites, handle license renewals tied to subscriptions, and deliver plugin updates to active license holders.

- "Instant checkout isn't in yet, but it's something we've talked about and already planning as a future add-on" - Planned feature
- "Does WPSubscription work with Cartflows? If yes, how does it work if a Cartflows Bump or Upsell was a separate subscription/product?" - CartFlows integration
